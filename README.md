# Optimization_Python

This repository contains Python codes for simulating global optimization algorithms with various benchmark test problems. It is designed to be flexible for the user to add:

  + Objective functions
  + Initialization methods for the optimizers
  + Specific optimization algorithms

Directories:

  + OptimPy: the package containing all the source files
  + example: contains the interface to start the simulation
  
Requirement:

  + Python 2.7
  + Numpy
  + Matplotlib
